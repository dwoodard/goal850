Using Mermaid markdown to create a flowchart need for this.

Project:

I have a funnel of "Loan Declines" and they are going to be put into a spreedsheet and uploaded to go highlevel.

at this point, I want go highlevel to use the trigger 'Create Contact' to start the automation.

this is where i need help with coming up with a Marketing Strategy to get the leads to convert.

I want a Golden Path where say yes to everything, but a drip campaign for those that say no.
use Mermaid to convay this information and show a flowchart and also show in detail the mindset of why this is the best path to take.

the main goal is to get the leads to convert and to make the most money possible.

We'll have affiliates and we'll have a marketing strategy to get the leads to convert.

I'm not fully clear on the marketing strategy, but I know that I want to use go highlevel to automate the process.
